## Daily Plan
| Day | Goal |
|-----|------|
| 1, 2, 3| In the first 3 days I have plans on getting all of my basic CRUD routes and pages funtioning correctly. As wellas displaying all information that I want displayed on each page.|
| 4, 5 | On day 4 and 5 I want to focus mostly on styling.  I want to put a background picture as well as make sure all of my components are placed correctly.|
| 6, 7 |  On these two days I have plans to add authentification.  If something is not finished from the pryor days, this will also be the days that I provide and update these features.|
